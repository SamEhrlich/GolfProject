    "This python notebook is designed to pull the weather data from NOAA's API and transform the data into a clean dataframe. That dataframe will be saved as a CSV and moved to the file share for the team to use. The goal is to be able to join this dataset by end date (and location if needed) to the other completed datasets. This file will contain the lows, highs, percipitation for each day that has been recorded. I am looking for a way to add in average daily temp, but I may just take the high and low to make a mean temp for the day. I am using the requests package to pull data for the 5 courses we chose to pull weather on. We chose these specific 5 courses because they are played every year and are held in the same location. This is great for exploratory analysis, because we can see differences in the year to year results using the weather/location."
