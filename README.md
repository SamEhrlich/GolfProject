# GolfProject
This was my work portion of a summer project. In this project I analyze factors that may impact the performance of golfers in the PGA from 2015-2022.
I go through the entire data storytelling lifecycle through each of these files. I begin by getting raw golf data from rawsportsdata and combining that
to weather data that I request through the historic weather data service NOAA. I clean the data, add in a column that counts the streaks that the golfers
made during their time in the PGA. I upload all the data to a structured database for easy querying later in the project. I then make visualizations and 
create machine learning models to see the importance between features and the golfer's performance. At the end I created a table of contents in Rmarkdown
to provide links through each step of the process.
